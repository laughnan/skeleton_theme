# Skeleton Boilerplate
Adapted from Skeleton (http://getskeleton.com/), this project is meant to be a boilerplate, SASS-centric Drupal theme providing basic styling and a grid system.

### NOTES
- (5/25/15) The `css` and `.sass-cache` directories are hidden by default. To generate the CSS, use `compass compile`.
- (5/25/15) The Raleway type is set in the `html.tpl.php` file by default. This will be removed in favor of including this in the CSS/SCSS files.
