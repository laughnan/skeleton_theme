# Skeleton Boilerplate
Adapted from Skeleton (http://getskeleton.com/), this project is meant to be a boilerplate, SASS-centric Drupal theme providing basic styling and a grid system.

### NOTES
- The `css` and `.sass-cache` directories are hidden by default. To generate the CSS, use `compass compile`.
